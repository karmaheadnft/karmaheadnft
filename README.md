WHITEPAPER 1

IN BRIEF

The Karma Head Music NFT Collection, by female musician, Karma Head is comprised of twelve
Audio-Visual Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs). Each NFT is formulated in two layers: one individual
analog song from the Karma Head Plastic World album and one digital Karma Head Character. The
characters have been designed by the renowned visual artist, Andrew Tarusov,
(https://www.instagram.com/askandy), in collaboration with female NFT artist, Masha Samoshina.
Each of the ‚ÄòKarma Head Characters‚Äô represent empowered Dolce Vitas that visually showcase the
enchanting sonic world of each song from the album. The Limited Collection will provide a
completely new style of utility. Each NFT comes with granted ‚Äòpatronage‚Äô which is comprised of a 1%
share in the Karma Head Enterprise1 and further physical utility as detailed in this white paper.
The collection has been carefully curated to set the tone for this unique genre of NFTs. We seek to
restore culture and progress independent music through the power and innovation of the

blockchain. The collection is backed by our experienced team, resources and Analog Post-
Production Recording Studio.

PHILOSOPHY AND MISSION

Philosophy
Music and Musicianship are a necessity in the evolution of humankind. Music evokes all of
our emotive senses. From the mathematics of rhythm ‚Äî to the literary heart of orchestration and
arrangement ‚Äî the science of frequency ‚Äî the architecture of structure ‚Äî to the visual element of
being inspired by the by the world around us; ‚Äî music encompasses our history, our now and
provides the ideation of how the future will manifest.
It brings us together as human beings. Together, we are united by life‚Äôs vocation. Beauteous are the
collective stories and the nostalgia we share with each other. We are each given the patterns to
weave our own individual patchwork coverlets, whatever our vocation and destination.
As Frank Zappa, once said:
‚Äúwithout music to decorate it, time is just a bunch of boring production deadlines or dates by which
bills must be paid‚Äù. ‚Äî
Music makes us dance ‚Äîit brings us together, but never tears us apart. Unless ‚Äî you‚Äôre in a band ‚Äî
that sometimes happens too...
Music is the rhythm of the soul. The simple act of listening is all it asks of us, and the reward shall
forever outlive the expectations of our imaginations.
Mission

The music industry is riddled with issues that must be alleviated in order to preserve the culture of
music. Our mission is to address these issues through the power of web3 innovative technologies.
At Karma Head, we believe in cultural progression that is ethical and just. For too long, musicians
have been deeply impacted by the music industry, particularly since the introduction of the web2

streaming royalty paradigm. The Karma Head NFT collection seeks to change the narrative of that
story.
By implementing blockchain technologies through the Music NFT collection, we have come
together to create a musical experience that is multifaceted and subsequently reintegrated
through licensing the music to the metaverse via games, films and events. The aim of this is to bring
the collection to the forefront of the everchanging and developing metaverse landscape. Through
the empowerment of our independent music, we are embracing the new wave of musical revolution
that is making its departure from the current music business model. By maximising blockchain
technology through innovative conceptualisation and execution, our mission is to restore the
cultural importance of music.
Karma Head possesses 100% ownership of the music rights of Plastic World and is free of the
complicated rights and royalty issues that often surround music ownership and subsequent shares.
In addition, Karma Head also has an independent catalog of over 500 songs and 40,000 music
stems from her career as a writer and producer at her Post-Production recording studio.

THE PROBLEMS

The Problem with the Music Industry
In recent years, the fundamental pillar of the music industry - musicians, have been hit hardest due
to structural level changes in the industry. These include the transition from record sales to
streaming services (which can no longer measure true ‚Äòfandom‚Äô), the reduction and dilution of artist
share royalties, in addition to the two-year halt on tours and festivals due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
The most damaging of these changes is the switch to streaming services, who on average pay
musicians only $3000 per one million streams. According to a report by the United Kingdom‚Äôs
Intellectual Property Office, only 0.4% of musicians in the UK generate enough streams to make a
sustainable living from music and streaming.
This reduction in revenue has not only had an impact on musicians but also production houses and
their publishing arms too. This has led to less experimentation across the artistry of music, whereby
a cookie-cutter approach has been implemented when it comes to production. Let us not forget
that music is an art and not a science. Ultimately, the cultural incentive that stems from the epicentre
of artistry has become fragmented. The impact of this has led to an obtuse obliteration of
transparency regarding royalties, copyright and more importantly - creative possibilities.

The Problem with Music NFTs

In 2020, musicians, producers and publishers began to explore NFTs as a way to increase artist
revenue and move away from the industry model. However, most music projects utilising this
technology have left the full potential of blockchain technologies beyond monetization through
NFTs unrealised. As the technology and utilities evolve, underlying problems with certain models are
becoming evident.
There is a lack of understanding around copyright, publishing rights and master rights. The mass
ownership of commercial music has caused complex publishing and licencing issues. Very few
entities in the Web3 music space are resolving such issues through the implementation of the
blockchain. Bringing this lack of clarity on-chain exacerbates fan, artist and investor protection
issues. It also discredits the potential plethora of Music NFT possibilities.
What is more, there lies a saturation of low-quality Music NFTs and re-releaseswhich flood the web3
market. Re-releases lead to further problematic circumstance surrounding rights, which prompts
investor reluctancy in turn. Low-quality music NFTs that exhibit poor recording and mastering
techniques are not equipped to meet the ‚Äòindustry audio standard‚Äô when the integration into the
wider web3 space prevails an opportune moment. For instance, a poorly recorded track may start
to distort if it is streamed in a metaverse.

The final issue is with utility. The most popular utility models involve the artist offering their master
rights, publishing rights or royalties. In addition to the ethical issues that are prevalent - the structure
of this model concludes that these Music NFTs cannot be reintegrated into the metaverse; nor can

they be physically distributed. This model is simply bringing old-school fundraising techniques on-
chain, whilst stripping artists of the most important rights over their music in the process. This in turn,

prevents monetization beyond the Music NFT sale itself.
The most popular model of selling streaming royalties is dependent on the algorithmic lottery of
success via web2 streaming services, (Spotify, Apple Music, Amazon Music etc.). Subsequent
models of which are the very reason artists are failing to generate a stable income. Therefore, such
utilities present no potential for full integration into web3 and do not cultivate the growth of the
models within the sphere of blockchain.
Finally, as we mentioned in the previous section, artists generate around $3000 per one million
streams. As a result of diluted royalties, this jeopardises budding investors as they are left with little
chance of gaining a return on their investment. The Karma Head NFT collection is solving all of these
issues simultaneously.

THE KARMA HEAD NFT COLLECTION

The Karma Head Music NFT collection is comprised of 12/12 Analog Audio-Visual NFTs. The genesis
collection will be minted on the Ethereum Blockchain in collaboration with Vinci. Each of the NFTs
feature two layers:
Layer 1: Upon Mint
o Unique 1/1 ‚ÄòKama Head Character‚Äô artwork by Andrew Tarusov & Masha Samoshina.
o Sneak preview of 1/12 songs from the 12/12 collection.
Layer 2: ‚ÄòExclusive Unlockable Content‚Äô which includes:
o 1/12 unreleased songs from the Plastic World album.
o 1% patronage share in the Karma Head Enterprise.
o Further physical utility.

The twelve female characters that offset the visual layer uncover the sonic and artistic themes of
each song. These characters embody the aethereal qualities of femininity.
Stylistically, the music was crafted with the intent to create an original work that is symbolic of the
modern world whilst preserving the analog recording tradition with her band. The artwork amplifies
this in a Modernised Pulp Noir style.
The Music NFTs have an underlying tone that celebrate the divine masculine and feminine in an age
where femininity is often politicised and polarised. Unity, appreciation and spirituality are at the heart
of the collection.


THE UTILITY

The utility devised has been designed to respect the integrity of Music NFTs, NFT Investors and the
project; with the intent to benefit all parties in the ecosystem. The collection introduces the following
new concepts;
Shares in the Karma Head Enterprise:
Each NFT comes with a 1% share in the album and future work by Karma Head, which includes:
Future NFT Releases*, Vinyl Album Distribution*, Sync Licensing Royalties*.
1. *Future NFT releases: Each of the Karma Head NFT holders will receive a 1% revenue stream from
NFT releases after the Karma Head x Vinci drop in November 2022. The second NFT collection will
launch in December 2022. This collection will be in partnership with Decentraland.
2. *Vinyl Album Distribution: Upon distributing the album as a physical release, Karma Head x Vinci
NFT holders will receive a 1% share of these sales. The first vinyl album drop will commence 3 months
after the Karma Head x Vinci NFT drop in partnership with The Vinyl Factory.
To amplify the analog recording medium, the album will be released on Vinyl in limited edition
packages. Subsequently,thiswillmelt the boarders between web3 and ‚Äòthe real world‚Äô and introduce
‚Äòreal world‚Äô music enthusiasts to the web3 sphere.
3. *Sync Licensing Royalties: Although we are fully web3 integrated, we will be adapting alongside the
technological progression of commercial companies entering the web3 ecosystem. For example,
Netflix and Film Franchises that have a grasp on the web2 community. To be in alignment with these
progressions, we will be at the forefront of licensing our music to these commercial companies.
To clarify: the Patrons of Karma Head will receive a 1% revenue stream per NFT of the above. By
sharing revenue streams with the NFT holders, this enables Karma Head to stay ahead of the curve
as an independent artist and share the benefits with the parties involved.
Further utility includes:
o Physical Airdrops, (merchandise, vinyl‚Äôs and NFT tickets to live concerts).
o Automatic Allow List spots for future NFT releases. Next upcoming: Karma Head x
Decentraland NFT Collection.
o Live concerts, (access to live concerts and meet & greets). Dcentralize Festival 2023,
NFT.London ‚Äì awaiting to be confirmed slot.

o Metaverse exclusives, (access to exclusive VIP areas, metaverse concerts and meet & greets).

o Discounts and perks for our partnerships with fashion designers, metaverse film franchises and
NFT ticketed events.
o Exclusive access to the Plastic World Film (to be confirmed).

ABOUT US

So, we need to tell you a bit about us: Hannah-Maria and Eve Bloom and the Co-Founders of Music
Mothership, (an umbrella company accommodating the Karma Head NFT collection). The series of
NFTs marks the genesis in the exciting future of the Karma Head musical vocation. What‚Äôs more, we
want you share this enchanting voyage with us!
Our introduction to Music NFTs was initiated by our side hustle as crypto traders. Upon our learnings
on the potential of Music NFTs and how they can bring a transformational empowering force to
music, we delved into the metaverse space to explore the potential of what Music NFTs can really
bring to web3. After extensive research, examining Music NFT platforms, to evaluating Music NFT
consumer demand, we finally established where the happy medium lies in bringing value to Music
NFTs.

This isn‚Äôt our first rodeo: As students in 2015 we started tackling the issue of music creator access to
resources. We provided musicianswith a database of free music stems and organically became the
top provider in the free music stem3 sphere. As a three person team, (in collaboration with a
developer from the Ministry of Sound at the time), the hub we created reached 100,000 hits per
month.
We understand what‚Äôs good and bad about the music industry, having spent years working in the
publishing, production and live scene. We understand the problems and have spent quite some
time racking our brains for the solutions! Hannah-Maria is the musical mind, (Bachelor of Music
(Hons), Royal Irish Academy Of Music, Classical Composition) and Eve has a background in
qualitative research, fine art and analog equipment brokerage, (Master of Arts (Hons), University of
Aberdeen, Theology).
Before creating the Karma Head alias,Hannah-Mariaworked as a producer, composer and has been
involved in the live music scene in London with jazz, electronic and rock bands. Eve has worked as a
fine art specialist and analog equipment broker.

3 Stems are sub-mixes or individual instrumentals e.g. Guitar, bass, vocals and drums. Which are then layered on top of each other to
create a song.

Together, over the last seven years we built an Analog Post-Production Recording Studio, complete
with a 48-channel Neve console, Studer tape machines and analog hardware (if you continue to
follow our story you will learn that this project is run by total analog fanatics!). In addition, our network
of developers, engineers, musicians and producers are friends we have made along the way, (Abbey
Road Studios, Ministry of Sound, Real World Studios, RAK Studios, Limetree Studios [Germany] and
the BBC).
Our passion is to contribute to progressive culture, particularly given the recent historical events
that have led to the web3 music revolution, (fear not ‚Äì we aren‚Äôt going to talk about COVID). Music
has reached a breaking point and it is imminent now more than ever that we ‚Äì the DeFi people, take
back the power and create a new music economy that is empowering through the blockchain.

THE KARMA HEAD STORY

"I didn‚Äôt want to create an album that sounded the same as everything else out there. So what was I
going to do? Become the next Joni Mitchell or Maya Jane Coles? Imitating my idols wasn‚Äôt going to
work either. So I found myself in the quietness of lockdown with a piano and a notepad.
The ambitionbehindtheprojectwas towrite anoriginal albumwitha conscience anda realmessage
that is reflective of these times. Everything you hear on the ‚ÄòPlastic World‚Äô album was created
organically with no edits, autotune or plug-ins. The album was crafted in the analog tape medium,
with the intent to create a unique and raw sound world.
During the 18 month period of writing and producing ‚ÄòPlastic World‚Äô, I became acutely aware that
the majority of music had become more so about being trend-orientated and less about creating
something unique and socially conscious. Part ofthe trendiness is relative to the centralised control
of the music industry.
As amusicianwholikes tochallenge creativeboundaries, Iwantedtodiscover a tangible identity that
is reflective of these times and the experiences we face as individuals in the modern world. Albeit,
with a fun approach! There is something about artistic freedom that captures creativity in a way like
no other and that‚Äôs human spirit.‚Äù
